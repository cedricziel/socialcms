# SocialCMS

This extension is a naive implementation of the activitystrea.ms spec.
The model is solely taken from the Apache Rave (https://github.com/apache/rave)
application library.

## TYPO3 Extension

Okay, this is important:

This is solely a implementation of the activitystrea.ms spec to see how modern
web applications can be combined and implemented within TYPO3.CMS.

It strives to see how tuning of the persistence layer needs to be done, what are the bottlenecks,
how caches need to intercept etc.

## License

As a derivative of Apache Rave and due to the tainting of GPLv2+ in TYPO3.CMS,
I am not to decide about it. Choose wether you think this is GPLv2+ or Apache v2.
